The PID controller is made up of three components that each affect the output
differently. The first, proportion, allows the car to turn towards the intended
destination. However, this section alone will cause the car to overshoot the
target without an easy way to correct itself. The derivative portion of the
controller corrects for this error. However, the PD alone will cause the car to
constantly zig zag around the intended driving line. The integration portion of
the controller completes the system and accounts for long term changes in error
from the PD portions. This removes the zig zag.

To find the weights, twiddle was used to constantly test different
configurations of weights. Ultimately I was getting a negative value for the "I"
portion of the controller, but inverting the sign gave me the constants I needed
to get around the track.
